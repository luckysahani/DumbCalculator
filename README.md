# DumbCalculator
# CS654 Software Architecture Assignment 1
In this assignment, you are supposed to build a Dumb Arithmetic Calculator (DAC) and an
accompanying Web Application. A DAC can present the User with an interface which can
take inputs, but can not process them itself. Instead, the operands and operator are ferried
over to an application, running on a server, which performs the requested operation on the
given operands, and return the result.
For example, if the DAC sends “4.5”, “3.23” and “+” to the server, it would receive a reply
“7.73”. You are free to have as many operators you wish in the app, but a minimum of four
operators, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, are a must.
The Web Application running on the server, on the receipt of the requests, do the
computation and returns the result. However, it simulates a cache to see if a specific request
had been sent to it before, and replies to the request from the stored result in the cache,
instead of recomputing the same. To simulate the cache, the Web Application can make use of
any persistence option, say a MySQL table, or even a simple File, and store the request triplets
it receives, along with the response it sent for them.
The DAC has to be implemented as an Android App. On the server side, you are free to pick
any Server Side Scripting language that you are familiar with (e.g. PHP, Java, Python, Ruby
etc.), deployed over Linux environment.
